I - Introduction.

	ImdExporter is a 3dsmax plugin that allows you to
export 3d data and textures. It handle texture resizing to
the nearest sqUare value. It uses the devil library for the
texture conversion. It can export:
- bones and skinning
- sampled animation
- matrix animation
- static object
- mesh stripping at export

II - Installation.

	Copy:
- ImdExp.dle in the 3dsmax/plugins/ directory
- devil.dll, ilu.dll, ilut.dll in the WINNT/System32/ directory
- msvcp71.dll, MFC71.dll, msvcr71.dll (Visual 7.1 runtimes) in WINNT/System32/ directory
	

III - How to use.

	After modeling you object under 3dsmax, go to file - export menu. A dialog
box will open. Choose the directory and type in the filename with the extension .IMD,
press OK. A new dialog box appears which contains the export options of the IMD.

	The options:
- OBJECT:
	- Export object data: allows the export of the 3d data
	- Only selected object: not supported =|
	- Sample animations: tells the plugin that you're going to save animation
	  in the IMD.
	- Static frame: exports a single frame from an animation (NOT the full animation)
	- Sample Matrix: tells the plugin to sample the matrix instead of the vertex (not supported by iris)
	- sample Vertex: tells the plugin to apply the matrix modifiers before exporting the mesh
	- export skin data: exports skinning data
- BONES:
	- export bones data: exports bones data
	- sample matrix animation: you need to give the path of the animation (.imdbone)
- DEBUG:
	- open 3d viewer when finished export: not working
	- open log window: displays the log
	- open DOS log window: do not use that

IV - Notes.

	Things to do in 3dsmax in order to be able to use the exporter:
- use textures as diffuse maps
- doesn't support objects of a single triangle
- doesn't support sub materials
- report any other bugs, or request features
